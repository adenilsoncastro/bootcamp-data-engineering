-A container manager, intended to virtualize the environment where the application is running.
Once it is done, the application can run in any machine, regardless of the OS

'docker build -t web_apache .' --> build the 'web_apache' application using the files in '.' folder
'docker image ls' --> shows all available docker images
'docker run -p 80:80 web_apache' --> run the web_apache image at port 80:80 (pc:container)
'docker run -d -p 80:80 web_apache' --> run the web_apache image at port 80:80 (pc:container) and detach from terminal
'docker ps' --> shows all images that are in execution
'docker stop' --> stops the image execution
